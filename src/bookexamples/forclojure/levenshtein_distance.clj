;;; Problem 101:
;;  Given two sequences x and y, calculate the Levenshtein distance of x and y, i. e. the minimum number of edits needed to transform x into y. The allowed edits are:
;;   - insert a single item
;;   - delete a single item
;;   - replace a single item with another item
;;  Function memoization should make the simple algorithm work like a dynamic programming algorith(see the memoization example)
