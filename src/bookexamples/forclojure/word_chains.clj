;;; Problem 82: Word chains
;;A word chain consists of a set of words ordered so that each word differs by only one letter from the words directly before and after it. The one letter difference can be either an insertion, a deletion, or a substitution. Here is an example word chain:
;;
;;cat -> cot -> coat -> oat -> hat -> hot -> hog -> dog
;;
;;Write a function which takes a sequence of words, and returns true if they can be arranged into one continous word chain, and false if they cannot.

(defn word-chains [words]
